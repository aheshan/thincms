thincms
=======

A very basic thincms for building small sites using content management and wordpress approach. Generally i found it difficult when i have to build content management in any web-application. If i choose wordpress i have to follow it's rules also i can't code in normal way as beginner can but i have to follow it's rules. So i decided to build my own cms for building sites in core php way but using modern trend that composer provides.
